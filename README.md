Building a Data Pipeline for a Mobile App using AWS Services

This repository contains code and instructions for building a data pipeline for a mobile app using AWS services. The pipeline includes data ingestion using Amazon Kinesis, data processing using AWS Lambda, data storage in Amazon S3, data transformation using AWS Glue, and data warehousing using Amazon Redshift.
Getting Started

To use the code in this repository, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/shrinidhibarthur/MobileStream_using_AWS_services.git

2. Create an Amazon Kinesis data stream by following the instructions in the AWS documents.

3. Create an AWS Lambda function by following the instructions in the AWS documents.

4. Store the processed data in an Amazon S3 bucket by following the instructions in the AWS documents.

5. Clean and prepare the data using AWS Glue by following the instructions in the AWS documents.

6. Store the transformed data in Amazon Redshift by following the instructions in the AWS documents.

Impact:
Building a data pipeline for a mobile app using AWS services can have a significant impact on the app owners' ability to gain insights into user behavior and improve the app experience. Let's consider the impact using some simulated numbers:

Assuming that the mobile app has 1 million active users who generate 10 events per day on average, the data pipeline would need to process around 10 million events per day. This data can be collected in real-time using AWS Kinesis, which can handle up to 1,000 transactions per second, providing the necessary scalability for high volume data streams.

Once the data is collected, AWS Lambda can be used to process and analyze the data in real-time. With a processing time of a few milliseconds per event, AWS Lambda can easily handle the processing load for this volume of data.

After processing the data, the transformed data can be stored in Amazon S3, which can handle up to 3500 PUT requests per second, providing the necessary scalability for high volume data storage.

AWS Glue can be used to clean and prepare the data for analysis. AWS Glue can handle large data volumes, allowing data to be processed in parallel to save time.

Finally, the transformed and cleaned data can be stored in Amazon Redshift, which can handle petabyte-scale data warehouses. With Amazon Redshift, the app owners can easily run complex queries and analyze the data to gain insights into user behavior.

In conclusion, building a data pipeline for a mobile app using AWS services can help app owners to gain valuable insights into user behavior, which can help improve the app experience and drive user engagement. The impact can be significant, enabling app owners to process, store and analyze large volumes of data in real-time and at scale.

With AWS services, there is no need to invest in hardware, software licenses, or maintenance, which can result in significant cost savings for app owners.

Let's consider some cost estimates for the pipeline. Assuming that the pipeline processes 10 million events per day, with an average event size of 1 KB, the total data processed per day would be around 10 GB.

For Amazon Kinesis, the cost would be approximately Rs. 2,500 per day, assuming that the data is stored for 24 hours and the standard tier is used.

For AWS Lambda, assuming an average processing time of 50 milliseconds per event, the cost would be around Rs. 500 per day.

For Amazon S3, assuming that the data is stored for 30 days and accessed occasionally, the cost would be around Rs. 10,000 per month.

For AWS Glue, assuming that the data is processed for one hour per day, the cost would be around Rs. 10,000 per month.

For Amazon Redshift, assuming a data storage of 1 TB per month, the cost would be around Rs. 80,000 per month.

Therefore, the total estimated cost for the data pipeline would be around Rs. 1,30,000 per month. However, these costs can vary depending on the specific usage patterns and configurations of the AWS services.

When comparing the cost of building a data pipeline for a mobile app using AWS services versus traditional on-premises infrastructure, there are several factors to consider.

First, with traditional on-premises infrastructure, the app owners would need to purchase hardware, such as servers and storage devices, and set up their own data center. This can be expensive and time-consuming, requiring a large upfront investment.

In contrast, with AWS services, the app owners can use pay-as-you-go pricing, only paying for the resources they use. This can provide significant cost savings, especially for smaller businesses or those with fluctuating data processing needs.

Additionally, AWS services offer scalability and flexibility that traditional on-premises infrastructure may not provide. With AWS services, the app owners can quickly and easily scale up or down based on their data processing needs, without having to purchase and set up additional hardware.

Overall, building a data pipeline for a mobile app using AWS services can not only provide valuable insights into user behavior but can also result in significant cost savings compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure.
